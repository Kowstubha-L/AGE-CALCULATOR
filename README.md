# AGE-CALCULATOR
An age calculator using JavaScript is a web-based tool that allows users to determine their current age by entering their birthdate. The tool typically features a user-friendly interface with an input field where users can select their birthdate from a date picker. Upon submitting the birthdate, JavaScript functions calculate the difference between the current date and the entered date, converting this difference into years, months, and days. The calculated age is then displayed on the webpage. This application involves handling date objects, performing date arithmetic, and updating the DOM to show the result. It's a practical example of using JavaScript for real-world applications and enhancing user interaction on a webpage.
